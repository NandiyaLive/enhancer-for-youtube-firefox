# Enhancer for YouTubeâ„¢

Enhancer For YouTube can't be found on anywhere in Firefox Add-ons Store and MRFDEV has temporarily [stopped the distribution](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube).
So I'm going to upload the last working file here in case anyone (most probably me) wanted to re-install it in the future.

I don't own any rights of this product. I'm uploading only because I can't live without this add-on.
